### Day 2: March 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: For the first 30 minutes, I completed the Responsive Web Design Principles portion which help me review how to write media queries, make an image responsive, use a retina image for higher resolution displays, and make typography responsive. Afterwards, I joined my Lambda Labs team to work on testing and debugging our given app, We were able to complete most of the end to end testing of the back-end and got started on debugging the user interactions of the front-end portion.

For the second 30 minutes, I completed 10/17 of Flex Box.

**Thoughts** The subject of FreeCodeCamp are easier and faster to complete thanks to the Knowledge I earned from Lambda School 5 months ago. Completing FreeCodeCamp makes me feel refreshed and more confident.

### Day 3: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the 17/17 of CSS Flexbox and 3 / 22 from css grids. Created a submit form skeleton for a project and did research about AWS and OKTA.

**Thoughts** I enjoy doing freeCodeCamp exercises, it refreshes old content learned and also I leanerded a bit about grids which I tought it was a difficult concept, shows up its not. However, today i wasn't able to give it my all as I was laerning about AWS and OKTA to implemented on a project.

### Day 4: March 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed 17/22 of the CSS grid exercises from http://freeCodeCamp.org/skaj04
