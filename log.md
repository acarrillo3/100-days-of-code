# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I decided to join 100 day's of code to complete at least the front end portion of freeCodeCamp.org. With just one hour today I was able to complete the Applied Accessibility portion.

**Thoughts** I felt accomplished for compliting a portion. I learned the importance of making a web site accessible to people with disabilities.
